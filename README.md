# PROBLEM STATEMENT:-

Given a (partial) sequence of words in a sentence (a prefix), design a model that predicts the most likely next word(s) to complete the sentence. In other words, the task is next-word prediction / sentence auto-completion:

Input: a sequence of n words (or tokens) forming the beginning of a sentence

Output: the next word (or a short sequence of words) that is contextually most probable

Challenge: to learn from training text corpora how words and contexts co-occur, capturing long-term dependencies in text

Constraint: the model must deal with large vocabulary, variable sentence lengths, out-of-vocabulary words, and context ambiguity

Thus the model must generalize from training data to produce plausible completions for unseen or partially seen prefixes

# OBJECTIVES:-

The main objectives of this project would be:-

1) Build a language model using LSTM

2) Use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to model the sequential nature of text and learn to predict the next word in a sentence based on prior context.

Preprocess and encode textual data:

– Tokenize the text corpus

– Build vocabulary and map words to integer indices

– Create fixed-length input sequences (prefixes) and target next words

– Handle padding, truncation, and out-of-vocabulary tokens

Train and validate the model:

– Train the LSTM model using training data, optimizing parameters (e.g., via categorical crossentropy loss, suitable optimizer)

– Split data (e.g. training / validation) to monitor performance and avoid overfitting

– Tune hyperparameters (sequence length, embedding dimension, number of LSTM layers, dropout, batch size, epochs)

Evaluate performance:

– Measure metrics like prediction accuracy (top-1, top-k)

– Generate sample completions to qualitatively assess plausibility

– Possibly compute perplexity or other language-modelling metrics

Inference / deployment of the auto-completion system:

– Given a user’s partial sentence, preprocess it, feed into the trained model, and output the predicted next word

– Optionally iterate to auto-complete multiple words

– Provide a usable interface or demonstration of the system

Generalization and robustness:

– Handle prefixes not seen during training (generalization)

– Deal with noise, variations in style, less frequent words

– Optionally explore techniques (e.g. beam search, top-k sampling, smoothing) to improve predictions
