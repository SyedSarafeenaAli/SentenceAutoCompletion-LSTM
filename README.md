# PROBLEM STATEMENT:-

Given a (partial) sequence of words in a sentence (a prefix), design a model that predicts the most likely next word(s) to complete the sentence. In other words, the task is next-word prediction / sentence auto-completion:

Input: a sequence of n words (or tokens) forming the beginning of a sentence

Output: the next word (or a short sequence of words) that is contextually most probable

Challenge: to learn from training text corpora how words and contexts co-occur, capturing long-term dependencies in text

Constraint: the model must deal with large vocabulary, variable sentence lengths, out-of-vocabulary words, and context ambiguity

Thus the model must generalize from training data to produce plausible completions for unseen or partially seen prefixes

# OBJECTIVES:-

The main objectives of this project would be:-

1) Build a language model using LSTM

2) Use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to model the sequential nature of text and learn to predict the next word in a sentence based on prior context.

Preprocess and encode textual data:

– Tokenize the text corpus

– Build vocabulary and map words to integer indices

– Create fixed-length input sequences (prefixes) and target next words

– Handle padding, truncation, and out-of-vocabulary tokens

Train and validate the model:

– Train the LSTM model using training data, optimizing parameters (e.g., via categorical crossentropy loss, suitable optimizer)

– Split data (e.g. training / validation) to monitor performance and avoid overfitting

– Tune hyperparameters (sequence length, embedding dimension, number of LSTM layers, dropout, batch size, epochs)

Evaluate performance:

– Measure metrics like prediction accuracy (top-1, top-k)

– Generate sample completions to qualitatively assess plausibility

– Possibly compute perplexity or other language-modelling metrics

Inference / deployment of the auto-completion system:

– Given a user’s partial sentence, preprocess it, feed into the trained model, and output the predicted next word

– Optionally iterate to auto-complete multiple words

– Provide a usable interface or demonstration of the system

Generalization and robustness:

– Handle prefixes not seen during training (generalization)

– Deal with noise, variations in style, less frequent words

– Optionally explore techniques (e.g. beam search, top-k sampling, smoothing) to improve predictions

# DATASET AND FEATURES:-

DATASET:

Source / Type of Data - The dataset is typically a text corpus (collection of natural language sentences, paragraphs, documents). It should cover enough variety of language use (vocabulary, styles, domains) so the model generalizes.

FEATURES:

Features / Representations (Inputs and Outputs) - To train a model to predict the next word, we convert the dataset into input-output pairs (features, labels).

1. Sliding Window / Context Sequences

Choose a context window length 𝐿. This is how many preceding words are considered as input. For each position in the text (starting from word index 𝐿), you take the previous 𝐿 words as input (the “prefix”), and the (𝐿 + 1)𝑡ℎ word as the target (output).
This sliding continues across the entire corpus, producing many (input, target) pairs.
Sometimes the inputs are padded or truncated (if contexts are shorter or longer) to make fixed-length input vectors for batch training.

2. Numerical / Vector Representation (Features)

Neural networks cannot directly take words (strings) as inputs, so we encode them:

i) Word indices / integer encoding

Each word in the vocabulary is assigned an integer (from 1 to 𝑉, for example). The input sequence of words becomes a sequence of integers (length = 𝐿). The target is also an integer (the index of the next word). 

ii) One-hot encoding (optional, for output / internal representation)

The target integer is converted to a one-hot vector of dimension 𝑉, with 1 in the position of the true next word, 0 elsewhere. Sometimes inputs might also be one-hot encoded, though embedding layers are more common now.

iii) Embedding / dense vector representation

Use an embedding layer in the model: the integer word index is mapped to a dense vector 𝑒 ∈ 𝑅𝑑Thus each input sequence becomes an 𝐿×𝑑 matrix of embeddings.

3. Target / Output Feature

The target (label) is the next word (as an integer or a one-hot vector). The model’s output layer usually has shape 𝑉, with a softmax activation to produce a probability distribution over possible next words.
